"""
Problem:
- Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element
  in constant time.
Approach:
- We use two stack implementation themselves: one holds all the items and the
  other holds all the minimum values after each push() and pop().
Cost:
- O(n) time, O(n) space.
